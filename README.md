# Crop Production Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze crop production data to uncover valuable insights and trends. The analysis involves cleaning and preprocessing the data, loading it into the analysis environment, and using various data visualization techniques to understand the patterns and factors affecting crop production.

## Steps

This project involves an analysis of crop production data. The primary steps include:

1. **Loading the Dataset**: Importing data into the analysis environment.
2. **Preprocessing and Cleaning the Data**: Handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
3. **Basic Data Visualization**: Using charts and graphs to visualize the cleaned data.
4. **Loading Data into Power BI**: Importing the dataset into Power BI for advanced visualizations.
5. **Making Dashboard**: Creating interactive and comprehensive dashboards in Power BI.
6. **Exporting Dashboard**: Exporting the final dashboard for presentation 
## Files

List and describe your files:

1. `cleaning.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data cleaning.
2. `Crop Production Data.csv`: CSV file containing crop production data.
3. `Mydashboard.pbix`: Power BI dashboard for visualizing crop production data.
